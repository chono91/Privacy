Privacy Policy for The Life List
Last updated: February 27, 2026

This privacy policy describes how The Life List ("the app", "we", "us") handles your information.

Summary

The Life List is a household organizer for travel packing, grocery and inventory tracking, pet care, chore management, and shared feedback. Your data stays on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your data.

What Data the App Uses

The app stores the following data that you create:

Travel & Packing
- Trip names, packing list names, and item names
- Notes, quantities, and check-off status for items
- Kit and template configurations
- Bag assignments

Groceries & Inventory
- Store names and shopping lists
- Inventory items with stock levels and shelf life
- Receipt scan data (processed entirely on your device; images are not stored or transmitted)

Pet Care
- Pet profiles including name, species, breed, birthdate, and weight
- Care event logs (feedings, walks, medications, and other activities)
- Medication schedules and reminder preferences

Chore Tracker
- House names, chore categories, and chore items
- Completion history, streaks, and assignment details

Feedback
- Feedback board names, items, and notes
- Device model and app version are appended to feedback notes you create, to help with troubleshooting

When you use the "Import from Reminders" feature, the app reads your selected Reminders lists with your permission. Reminder titles and notes are copied into the app as packing items. The app does not modify or delete your Reminders.

Camera

The app uses your device camera to scan receipts for grocery inventory updates. Images are processed on your device using Apple's Vision framework for text recognition. No images are stored, transmitted, or sent to any server.

Notifications

The app can send local notifications to remind you about pet medication schedules. These notifications are generated entirely on your device. No notification data is sent to any server.

Where Data Is Stored

All data is stored locally on your device using Apple Core Data. If you are signed in to iCloud, your data is synced across your devices using Apple CloudKit. We do not operate any servers. We do not have access to your iCloud data. Your data is stored and managed entirely by Apple under your Apple ID.

Shared Spaces

If you share a space (such as a trip, pet profile, house, store, or feedback board) with another person using iCloud Sharing, the data in that space becomes visible to the people you invite. You control who has access and can revoke it at any time.

Third-Party Services

The app uses only Apple-provided services:

- Apple CloudKit for iCloud sync and sharing
- Apple Vision framework for on-device receipt text recognition
- Apple Reminders access for list import (only when you initiate it)
- Apple Push Notification service for CloudKit sync and local medication reminders

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking services.

Data Collection

We do not collect, transmit, or have access to any personal information. We do not track you. We do not use cookies. We do not serve ads.

Data Deletion

You can delete any data within the app at any time. You can export a full backup of your data from Settings before deleting. Uninstalling the app removes all local data. iCloud data can be managed through your device's iCloud settings.

Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
