Privacy Policy for The Life List
Last updated: February 16, 2026
This privacy policy describes how The Life List ("the app", "we", "us") handles your information.
Summary
The Life List is a travel packing list app. Your data stays on your device and in your personal iCloud account. We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your data.
What Data the App Uses
The app stores the following data that you create:
Trip names, packing list names, and item names
Notes, quantities, and check-off status for items
Kit and template configurations
Location coordinates, if you choose to add a location to a trip
When you use the "Import from Reminders" feature, the app reads your selected Reminders lists with your permission. Reminder titles and notes are copied into the app as packing items. The app does not modify or delete your Reminders.
Where Data Is Stored
All data is stored locally on your device using Apple CoreData. If you are signed in to iCloud, your data is synced across your devices using Apple CloudKit.
We do not operate any servers. We do not have access to your iCloud data. Your data is stored and managed entirely by Apple under your Apple ID.
Shared Trips
If you share a trip with another person using iCloud Sharing, the data in that trip becomes visible to the people you invite. You control who has access and can revoke it at any time.
Third-Party Services
The app uses only Apple-provided services:
Apple CloudKit for iCloud sync and sharing
Apple EventKit for Reminders import (only when you initiate it)
We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, crash reporting, or tracking services.
Data Collection
We do not collect, transmit, or have access to any personal information. We do not track you. We do not use cookies. We do not serve ads.
Data Deletion
You can delete any data within the app at any time. Uninstalling the app removes all local data. iCloud data can be managed through your device's iCloud settings.
Children's Privacy
We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
Changes to This Policy
If we update this policy, the revised version will be posted at this URL with an updated date.
